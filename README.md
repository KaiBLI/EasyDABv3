# EasyDABv3
Prototype EasyDABv3 Board Map and Schematic

This is an unfinished prototype and we are missing firmware for the SoC and FPGA for this project. I am uploading this here for preservation in case anyone fancies a go at resolving the existing issues with this prototype and to design firmware. 

Even with the original firmware for this board, there are existing incompatibilities between the FPGA and the SoC that may cause some 'problems'. If you need a DAB modulator, check out https://github.com/KaiBLI/EasyDABv2
